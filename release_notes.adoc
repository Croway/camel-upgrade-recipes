=== Migration coverage

[%autowidth,stripes=hover]
|===
| Migration | Coverage | Comment

| https://camel.apache.org/manual/camel-3x-upgrade-guide-3_3.html#_camel_jackson[camel-jackson JAXB annotations] | ⚠️ Partial | Warning comments added to code using enableJaxbAnnotationModule. Manual migration required: add jackson-module-jaxb-annotations dependency and configure JacksonDataFormat with setModuleClassNames().
| https://camel.apache.org/manual/camel-3x-upgrade-guide-3_3.html#_template_components[Template Components Security] | ⚠️ Partial | Warning comments added for template component usage (freemarker, velocity, mustache, mvel, string-template, chunk, jolt, jslt, robotframework). Manual migration required: add allowTemplateFromHeader=true to endpoint URIs.
| https://camel.apache.org/manual/camel-3x-upgrade-guide-3_3.html#_supervising_route_controller[SupervisingRouteController] | ❌ None | Not supported by the migration tool. Manual configuration changes required for Spring Boot users.
| https://camel.apache.org/manual/camel-3x-upgrade-guide-3_3.html#_camel_karaf[Camel Karaf Components] | ✅ Full | Dependencies for camel-undertow, camel-jgroups, camel-jgroups-raft, and camel-infinispan automatically removed.
| https://camel.apache.org/manual/camel-3x-upgrade-guide-3_3.html#_camel_maven_plugin[camel-maven-plugin] | ❌ None | Not applicable. The 'embedded' goal was removed (use 'run' goal instead).
| https://camel.apache.org/manual/camel-3x-upgrade-guide-3_3.html#_api_changes[API Changes - Dump Models] | ❌ None | Not supported by the migration tool. Removed classes: org.apache.camel.support.dump.*
| https://camel.apache.org/manual/camel-3x-upgrade-guide-3_3.html#_camel_main[camel-main API Relocation] | ✅ Full | Methods relocated from BaseMainSupport to MainConfigurationProperties are automatically migrated (e.g., main.addRoutesBuilder() → main.configure().addRoutesBuilder()).
|===

=== Manual migration steps required

After running the automated recipes, the following manual steps may be required:

1. **camel-jackson JAXB Annotations**: If using JAXB annotations with Jackson:
   ```xml
   <!-- Add dependency to pom.xml -->
   <dependency>
       <groupId>com.fasterxml.jackson.module</groupId>
       <artifactId>jackson-module-jaxb-annotations</artifactId>
   </dependency>
   ```

   ```java
   // Configure JacksonDataFormat
   JacksonDataFormat formatPojo = new JacksonDataFormat(TestJAXBPojo.class);
   formatPojo.setModuleClassNames(JaxbAnnotationModule.class.getName());

   // Or configure JacksonTypeConverters (in CamelContext global options)
   context.getGlobalOptions().put(JacksonConstants.ENABLE_TYPE_CONVERTER, "true");
   context.getGlobalOptions().put(JacksonConstants.TYPE_CONVERTER_TO_POJO, "true");
   context.getGlobalOptions().put(JacksonConstants.TYPE_CONVERTER_MODULE_CLASS_NAMES,
       JaxbAnnotationModule.class.getName());
   ```

2. **Template Components Security**: Add `allowTemplateFromHeader=true` to template component endpoints:
   ```java
   // Before (Camel 3.2)
   from("direct:start")
       .to("freemarker:template.ftl");

   // After (Camel 3.3) - to use dynamic templates via headers
   from("direct:start")
       .to("freemarker:template.ftl?allowTemplateFromHeader=true");
   ```

   This applies to: freemarker, velocity, mustache, mvel, string-template, chunk, jolt, jslt, robotframework components.

3. **SupervisingRouteController** (Spring Boot): Update configuration properties:
   ```properties
   # Before (Camel 3.2)
   camel.supervising.controller.enabled=true
   camel.supervising.controller.initial-delay=5000

   # After (Camel 3.3)
   camel.springboot.supervising-route-controller-enabled=true
   camel.springboot.supervising-route-controller-initial-delay=5000
   ```

4. **Karaf Commands Removed**: The following Karaf commands are no longer available:
   - `context-info`
   - `route-info`
   - `route-profile`
   - `route-step`

== 3.2.0

=== Manual migration steps required

After running the automated recipes, the following manual steps may be required:

1. **Rest Configuration API**: Update code using removed CamelContext methods:
   - `addRestConfiguration(RestConfiguration)` → Use `getRestConfiguration()` instead
   - `getRestConfiguration(String, boolean)` → Use `getRestConfiguration()` instead
   - `getRestConfigurations()` → Use `getRestConfiguration()` instead

2. **Component Configuration (Java)**: Update component configuration calls for affected components (kafka, aws, aws2, consul, etcd, infinispan, servicenow, ssh, stomp, xmlsecurity, yammer):
   ```java
   // Before
   KafkaComponent kafka = new KafkaComponent();
   kafka.setBrokers("mybroker:1234");

   // After
   KafkaComponent kafka = new KafkaComponent();
   kafka.getConfiguration().setBrokers("mybroker:1234");
   ```

3. **Spring Boot Properties**: Remove `.configuration` prefix from component properties:
   ```properties
   # Before
   camel.component.kafka.configuration.brokers=mybroker:1234

   # After
   camel.component.kafka.brokers=mybroker:1234
   ```

4. **Infinispan Endpoints**: Add context-path to endpoint URIs:
   ```java
   from("infinispan")  // Before
   from("infinispan:current")  // After
   ```

5. **Error Handling**: If using shared processors in onException/onCompletion at context level, extract to intermediate routes:
   ```java
   // Before
   onException(Exception.class).handled(true)
       .loadBalance().roundRobin().id("round")
       .to("mock:error", "mock:error2");

   // After
   onException(Exception.class).handled(true).to("direct:error");
   from("direct:error").loadBalance().roundRobin().id("round")
       .to("mock:error", "mock:error2");
   ```

6. **Time Patterns**: Convert time pattern strings to milliseconds:
   ```java
   from("timer:foo?period=5s")      // Before
   from("timer:foo?period=5000")    // After
   ```

7. **Avro RPC Users**: If using Avro RPC endpoints (avro://), add dependency:
   ```xml
   <dependency>
       <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
       <artifactId>camel-avro-rpc</artifactId>
       <version>3.2.0</version>
   </dependency>
   ```

8. **JMX Remote Access**: If you were using JMX Connector configuration, switch to standard JVM settings:
   ```
   -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=9913
   -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=false
   -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl=false
   -Djava.rmi.server.hostname=localhost
   ```
